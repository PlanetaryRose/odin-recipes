            You can't beat a homemade pasta sauce, with a base of tomato and meat that can be customized with whatever ingredients you want!
            
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>
                <li>half an onion, diced</li>
                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of sugar</li>
                <li>oregano, salt, pepper, thyme, chilli flakes, and any other spices you want</li>
                <li>Cornstarch, for thickening the sauce if desired</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large saucepan on high heat, add the ground beef, breaking it into chunks and cooking thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Next, add the diced onion and cook for at least a minute or two.</li>
                <li>Next, add the minced garlic followed by the can of diced tomatoes. <strong>Include the water from the can.</strong> If needed for a larger batch, add half a can of additional water.</li>
                <li>Bring the mixture to just about a simmer. Taste the sauce and if you find the taste a bit too acidic, then add the sugar and stir. Taste again and add more sugar if needed.</li>
                <li>Lower the heat as needed to keep the sauce at a simmer and stir occasionally. After about 3-5 mins of cooking, add spices to taste. 
                Turn off the heat but leave the sauce on the burner,</li>
                <li>Finally, if you want a thicker sauce, take about 1 teaspoon upto a tablespoon of cornstarch in a glass, and add a similar amount of cold water. 
                Stir until combined and then add this to the sauce and stir until thickened.</li>
                <li>If you make the sauce too thick, simply add more water or tomato sauce, and return the pan to the heat as needed.</li>
            </ol>
