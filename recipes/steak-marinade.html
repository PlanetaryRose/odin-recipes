        <h1>Simple Steak Marinade</h1>
        <p>A very basic recipe to flavor your steaks. Nothing fancy or complicated here! I made this to take advantage of some of the sauces in my fridge that seem to never
            get used enough, hopefully this helps you in the same way!

        <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>

                <li>In the bag or other container that you'll be marinating your steak in; add the balsalmic vinegar, steak sauce, worhcestershire sauce, and a dash of whiseky.
                    Mix together and taste, adjust the ratio of the liquids as desired.
                </li>
                <li>Next, add 1 teaspoon of each of the seasonings and mix. Taste again and add more seasoning or sauces until you like the taste.</li>
                <li> Finally, add your steak or other meat of choice and massage in the mixture. Recommend marinating for at least 1 day, but the longer the better! Enjoy!</li>
